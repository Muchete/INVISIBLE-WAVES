## Input Code
The code of our input device is stored the XXX.ino file. 
It will generate a data.txt file, looking like this:
```
4435,-0.016,-0.016,0.984,155,
4852,-0.016,-0.016,0.969,155,
5413,0.000,-0.031,1.000,155,
6044,-0.016,-0.016,1.000,155,
6760,-0.016,0.000,0.984,155,
7094,0.016,-0.016,0.969,155,
7681,-0.016,-0.016,1.000,155,
8385,0.000,0.031,0.969,154,
```
Where 4435 are the millis, -0.016 the G force of the X axis, -0.016 the G force of the Y axis, 0.984 the G force of the Z axis and 155 value of the microphone (143 should be complete silence).
